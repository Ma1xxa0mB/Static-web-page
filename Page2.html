                            In 1999, France Telecom launched its first ADSL broadband service. This marked the beginning of a new era for the internet in France. It offered speeds of up to 512 kb/s. This unprecedented speed made it possible to view web pages comfortably. This was a huge leap forward compared to the old RTC modems, which were limited to 56 kb/s. ADSL used the same copper telephone lines as RTC, but separated the frequencies to allow both internet access and telephone use.

                    <p>
                        Subsequently, another decisive step accelerated the movement: the end of France Télécom's monopoly on telephone lines. This change paved the way for unbundling, a measure that allowed internet service providers (ISPs) to use France Télécom's network without paying additional fees to the historical operator.

                    <p>
                        Commercially, this opening of the market did not immediately disrupt the balance. Wanadoo (a subsidiary of France Télécom, created in 1996) remained largely dominant, thanks to its legacy as a state monopoly and its already considerable subscriber base. However, its higher prices, compared to the new entrants, opened the door to increasingly aggressive competition.

                    <p>
                        Gradually, other players emerged or merged: Club internet joined forces with 9Cegetel, Cegetel merged with SFR, while Tiscali withdrew in 2006 after a failed attempt to enter the ADSL market. These developments demonstrate the dynamism of the market in the early 2000s.

                    <p>
                        It was in this context that a major player entered the scene: Free. In 2002, the operator completely disrupted the market by launching the first Freebox Triple Play.

                    <p>
                        By 2006, ADSL had more than 10 million subscribers and accounted for 94% of broadband access in France. Orange, Neuf and Free were the main ISPs, with a combined market share of nearly 82%.

                            In 2002, Free launched the first Triple Play box with an unprecedented offer combining access to three services, internet, telephone, and television for only 30 euros per month. At the time, there was no other comparable offer on the market.

                        Following this announcement, Stéphane Treppoz, CEO of AOL France, sighed, “This can't be happening… what a nightmare”. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXsXngvWPeY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Watch Stéphane Treppoz’s reaction following the announcement of the Triple Play box</a>.

                    <p>
                       At the time, the American group AOL, then one of the leading internet service providers (ISPs), offered a similar package for 45 euros per month, around 50% more expensive. Most other ISPs also charged 45 euros or more for their subscriptions.

                    <p>
                       Free's success was immediate. By the end of 2003, more than 500,000 people were subscribed to Free's ADSL service. The group then became the second-largest player in the sector with a market share of over 15%, far ahead of AOL France.

                    <h2 id="part4" class="section-title">The decline of ADSL</h2>
                    <p>
                        ADSL began to decline towards the end of 2014 due to competition from fibre optics. This was due to several technical limitations: 
                    </p>
                    <div class = "text-with-image adsl-cable-img"> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>ADSL is asymmetric, meaning that upload speeds (from the subscriber to the network) are lower than download speeds (from the network to the subscriber). Therefore, it takes much longer to send a file than to receive one.</li>
                            <li>The traditional telephone network cables used by ADSL are technically unreliable. They are very sensitive to bad weather and other environmental disturbances. As a result, they can suffer outages of varying severity, leaving you without a connection for several days.</li>
                            <li>The quality of an ADSL connection depends on how far the user's home is from the telephone exchange. The greater the distance, the slower the speed.</li>
                            <li>Finally, an unexpected phenomenon added to these issues was the theft of copper cables, resold illegally and causing sudden service interruptions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <img src="Images/Page2Photo4.jpg" alt="Copper cable" class="img-medium">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        These constraints have led to a major decision: from 31 January 2026, it will no longer be possible to subscribe to an ADSL box. The network will be completely shut down by 2030.
