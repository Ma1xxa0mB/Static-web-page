    "part3_p4": "Nevertheless, fibre continues to expand: in January 2025, 39.9 million premises were eligible, representing 91% of French territory, according to ARCEP. Estimates indicate that this percentage could reach 100% by the end of 2025, although this seems uncertain: 4.6 million premises still need to be connected, many of which are in complex or low-density areas.",
