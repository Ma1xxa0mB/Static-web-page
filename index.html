                    <p>
                        The history of the internet in France began in the late 1980s, when the global network initially developed in the United States for military and scientific purposes started being used by European researchers and academics. At first, it was a tool reserved for a technical elite, mainly in academic and professional circles.

                       In the 1990s, the internet began to become more widely available. In 1995, France had only a few hundred thousand internet users, but this figure rose to over 6 million in 2001 and exceeded 15 million in 2003. This rapid growth was accompanied by a change in perception, the internet gradually became an accessible tool and began to find its way into French households.

                        At the end of the 1990s, most users still accessed the web via RTC (Réseau Téléphonique Commuté), a slow and unstable technology using traditional telephone lines. 56k modems, recognisable by their connection sound, allowed only basic and restrictive browsing: connections were billed by the minute, and it was impossible to make phone calls and browse at the same time. Despite these limitations, RTC was the first gateway to the internet for millions of French people.

                        The real revolution began in 1999 with the emergence of ADSL, which marked the beginning of the broadband era. This faster, more stable and, above all, permanent technology revolutionised internet usage. For more details on the arrival of ADSL, <a href = "Page2.html">see the dedicated page</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Connections became continuous, content loaded more quickly, and flat-rate packages made the internet more accessible to a wider audience. Instant messaging, forums, blogs, online services and downloads became widespread. The internet became an integral part of domestic and school life, providing information, communication, and entertainment.

                        In the 2010s, France entered the era of Very High Speed Broadband thanks to the gradual rollout of fibre optics. This development reflected the growing demand for faster, more stable connections capable of supporting modern uses such as HD streaming, online gaming, teleworking, videoconferencing and connected devices.

                    <p>
                        Today, the internet has become indispensable to society. It shapes the way individuals communicate, consume, learn and work. However, constant innovation also brings new challenges, such as ensuring equitable access, protecting data, addressing digital vulnerabilities and regulating content.
